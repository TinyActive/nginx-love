# User Management - User Guide

## Overview

User Management is the core system for managing user accounts, roles, and permissions within the Nginx WAF Management Platform. This feature allows administrators to control who can access the platform and what they can do.

### Key Features

- üë• **User Account Management**: Invite, edit, and delete user accounts
- üîê **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Three distinct roles with predefined permissions
- üîë **Password Management**: Secure password handling with bcrypt hashing
- ‚ö° **User Status Control**: Enable/disable accounts without deletion
- üìä **User Statistics**: Track total users, active users, and administrators
- üîÑ **Password Reset**: Admin can reset user passwords

### User Roles

The system has **3 roles** with different levels of access:

| Role | Access Level | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full system access | Platform administrator with complete control including user management and domain deletion |
| **Moderator** | Technical operations | Can manage domains, SSL, ModSecurity, and backups but cannot delete domains or manage users |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access | Can view all features but cannot modify anything |

- ‚úÖ Log out and log back in
- ‚úÖ Contact another admin if you don't have permissions

---

### Issue 2: "Username already exists" Error

**Symptoms**: Cannot invite user due to duplicate username

**Solutions**:

2. Choose a different username
3. Check if account was previously created and deleted (may still exist as inactive)

---

### Issue 3: User Cannot Login After Creation

**Symptoms**: Newly invited user gets "Invalid credentials"

**Possible Causes**:
1. **Status is Inactive**: Account was created as inactive
2. **Wrong password**: User typing password incorrectly
3. **Wrong username**: User typing username incorrectly

## Security Best Practices

### Password Management

**Strong Passwords**:
- ‚úÖ Minimum 6 characters (system requirement)
- ‚úÖ Recommended: 12+ characters
- ‚úÖ Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- ‚úÖ Avoid common words or patterns
- ‚úÖ Don't reuse passwords from other systems

**Password Sharing**:
- ‚úÖ Share through secure channel (encrypted messaging, password manager)
- ‚ùå Don't share via email, Slack, Teams, SMS
- ‚úÖ User should change password after first login
- ‚úÖ Delete temporary passwords after sharing

**Password Reset**:
- ‚úÖ Only reset when necessary
- ‚úÖ Copy password immediately (shown only once)
- ‚úÖ Verify user identity before resetting
- ‚úÖ Log all password resets for audit

### Account Security

**Principle of Least Privilege**:
- ‚úÖ Start with Viewer role
- ‚úÖ Promote only when needed
- ‚úÖ Regular review of user roles
- ‚úÖ Demote when responsibilities change

**Account Lifecycle**:
- ‚úÖ Disable accounts immediately when user leaves
- ‚úÖ Review inactive accounts monthly
- ‚úÖ Delete old test/temporary accounts
- ‚úÖ Maintain audit trail

**Access Review**:
- ‚úÖ Quarterly review of all user accounts
- ‚úÖ Verify each user still needs access
- ‚úÖ Check if roles are still appropriate
- ‚úÖ Remove unnecessary admin privileges

### Monitoring

**Regular Checks**:
- üëÅÔ∏è Review "Last Login" column for inactive accounts
- üëÅÔ∏è Monitor "Recent Logins" statistics
- üëÅÔ∏è Check audit logs for suspicious activity
- üëÅÔ∏è Verify number of admin accounts is appropriate

**Red Flags**:
- üö® Multiple failed login attempts
- üö® Logins from unusual locations
- üö® Accounts that haven't logged in for 90+ days
- üö® Unusual number of admin accounts
- üö® Shared accounts (multiple people using same login)
